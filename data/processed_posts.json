My first impression of him was that of a quiet, shy guy who\u2019d keep to himself, do his job and head home.\n\nBut first impressions can often be deceiving.\n\nIn just a few weeks, I heard him speak eloquently in meetings, simplifying complex ideas in a way that everyone understood \u2014 even new joiners.\n\nI would go on to interact with him and find out how much we had in common\u2014 from table tennis to gym to discussing our same-same taste in cricket and anime. We went from colleagues to buddies in no time.\n\nProfessionally, this guy didn\u2019t just do his job \u2014 he excelled. Divyam was promoted at Google in less than 1.5 years, which for those who know, is basically the top 1% of the top 1%. Calling him a high performer would be an understatement.\n\nOn top of that, he helped almost everyone on the team, growing like mad in terms of both programming and soft skills - from small talk to deep tech discussions - I witnessed firsthand how a 10x engineer works.\n\nNow, you might be curious: why did he leave even though he was having a blast of a career at Google?\n\nThe answer is simple - having extended the boundaries of what it means to be an engineer so quickly - Divyam realized he\u2019s meant for something bigger (you\u2019d realize the same if you talked to him just once).\n\nWith that, I am elated to tell you all that a 10x engineer (who\u2019s growing more every day) just landed on the market:\n\n- Companies who are looking for top talent in ML - this is your chance, pay whatever it takes to hire him.\n\n- Founders looking for a tech co-founder, this is your shot, pitch him with all you've got.\n\n- VCs looking for a sure bet, this man already has two cool apps out with 10K+ downloads, and is always tinkering. Go chat with him and fund whatever idea he works on next.\n\nYou will thank me later if you get him!\n\n---\n\nDivyam, you\u2019re one of the best.\n\nIt was nothing short of an honor to have worked and have so much fun \u2014 outings/meetups/memories outside office with you. And while I plan to annoy you for a long time, not seeing you in office would surely sting.\n\nYou\u2019ll be missed, my friend :')\n\n\ud83d\udc99\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a",

Aptitude Test\n2. Technical Test\n\nWhile preparing for the aptitude test, I stumbled upon a goldmine of a YouTube playlist that broke down all the different question patterns in detail.\nI focused on mastering the patterns shown in those videos\u2014and honestly, it worked! I was able to solve most of the questions confidently.\n\nYouTube playlist: https://lnkd.in/gkNYSVNR\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Disclaimer:\nI took this test in Oct-Nov 2022. The format might have changed since then\u2014please verify the latest structure before you start preparing.\n\nHere\u2019s what the format of the Aptitude Test looked like (as of 2022):\n\u2022 Total Time: 120 minutes\n\u2022 Total Questions: 70\n\u2022 Sections: 7 (all mandatory & video proctored)\n\u2022 You could switch between sections.\n\nSections:\n\u2022 Numerical Computations \u2014 12 Qs\n\u2022 Numerical Reasoning \u2014 12 Qs\n\u2022 Abstract Reasoning \u2014 12 Qs\n\u2022 Diagrammatic Reasoning \u2014 12 Qs\n\u2022 Logical Reasoning \u2014 12 Qs\n\u2022 Comprehension 1 \u2014 5 Qs\n\u2022 Comprehension 2 \u2014 5 Qs\n\nMarking Scheme:\n+5 for every correct answer\n-2 for every incorrect one\n\nHope this helps, I\u2019ll soon share the details of my Technical Test experience.",
