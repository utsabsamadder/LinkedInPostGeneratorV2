  "text": "My best friend just left Google </3\n\n17th April 2024: It was my 3rd day at Google when I met Divyam. My first impression of him was that of a quiet, shy guy who’d keep to himself, do his job and head home.\n\nBut first impressions can often be deceiving.\n\nIn just a few weeks, I heard him speak eloquently in meetings, simplifying complex ideas in a way that everyone understood — even new joiners.\n\nI would go on to interact with him and find out how much we had in common— from table tennis to gym to discussing our same-same taste in cricket and anime. We went from colleagues to buddies in no time.\n\nProfessionally, this guy didn’t just do his job — he excelled. Divyam was promoted at Google in less than 1.5 years, which for those who know, is basically the top 1% of the top 1%. Calling him a high performer would be an understatement.\n\nOn top of that, he helped almost everyone on the team, growing like mad in terms of both programming and soft skills - from small talk to deep tech discussions - I witnessed firsthand how a 10x engineer works.\n\nNow, you might be curious: why did he leave even though he was having a blast of a career at Google?\n\nThe answer is simple - having extended the boundaries of what it means to be an engineer so quickly - Divyam realized he’s meant for something bigger (you’d realize the same if you talked to him just once).\n\nWith that, I am elated to tell you all that a 10x engineer (who’s growing more every day) just landed on the market:\n\n- Companies who are looking for top talent in ML - this is your chance, pay whatever it takes to hire him.\n\n- Founders looking for a tech co-founder, this is your shot, pitch him with all you've got.\n\n- VCs looking for a sure bet, this man already has two cool apps out with 10K+ downloads, and is always tinkering. Go chat with him and fund whatever idea he works on next.\n\nYou will thank me later if you get him!\n\n---\n\nDivyam, you’re one of the best.\n\nIt was nothing short of an honor to have worked and have so much fun — outings/meetups/memories outside office with you. And while I plan to annoy you for a long time, not seeing you in office would surely sting.\n\nYou’ll be missed, my friend :')\n\n💙❤️💛💚",

  "text": "How I Cracked the Goldman Sachs Engineering Campus Hiring Program (EHCP) Aptitude Test\n\nA lot of folks have reached out asking how I prepared for the aptitude test that comes before the Goldman Sachs EHCP interviews.\n\nSo here’s the breakdown:\n\nTo reach the interview stage, I first had to clear two rounds of online assessments:\n1. Aptitude Test\n2. Technical Test\n\nWhile preparing for the aptitude test, I stumbled upon a goldmine of a YouTube playlist that broke down all the different question patterns in detail.\nI focused on mastering the patterns shown in those videos—and honestly, it worked! I was able to solve most of the questions confidently.\n\nYouTube playlist: https://lnkd.in/gkNYSVNR\n\n⚠️ Disclaimer:\nI took this test in Oct-Nov 2022. The format might have changed since then—please verify the latest structure before you start preparing.\n\nHere’s what the format of the Aptitude Test looked like (as of 2022):\n• Total Time: 120 minutes\n• Total Questions: 70\n• Sections: 7 (all mandatory & video proctored)\n• You could switch between sections.\n\nSections:\n• Numerical Computations — 12 Qs\n• Numerical Reasoning — 12 Qs\n• Abstract Reasoning — 12 Qs\n• Diagrammatic Reasoning — 12 Qs\n• Logical Reasoning — 12 Qs\n• Comprehension 1 — 5 Qs\n• Comprehension 2 — 5 Qs\n\nMarking Scheme:\n+5 for every correct answer\n-2 for every incorrect one\n\nHope this helps, I’ll soon share the details of my Technical Test experience.",
